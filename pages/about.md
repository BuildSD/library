The BuildSD Primary Sources website is a place to research the history of San Diego's development - especially the development of our region's transportation & infrastucture - maintained by the [BuildSD](https://buildsd.org) team.

The BuildSD Primary Sources website is built with [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/), an open source framework for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that is developed by faculty librarians at the University of Idaho Library.

More information coming soon...
